      <Content>At The Gathering we believe that time to unplug from the noise and the laundry is essential for a
healthy, vibrant life. As such, we host quiet hours with complimentary coffee and snacks. Cost
for a visit is only $10. Donations appreciated for replenishing drinks and snacks. Pretend you
are in a library settingâ€”Yes! There are even books and magazines? so that all who visit truly

have the space and peace and quiet they have come for.</Content>
